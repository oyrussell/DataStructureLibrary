# A Growing Data Structure Library
This is my library to practice implementing more complex data structures.

## What do these data structures do?
All of these data structures are implemented as C++ classes and can work with templated data allowing for easy integration with any types of data projects. The data structures implemented in this library include...
#### - Circular Dynamic Array
#### - Treap
#### - Fibonacci Heap
#### - Heap

## The Circular Dynamic Array (C++)
This Circular Dynamic Array has the following attributes:
  #### - Capacity Doubles when trying to add data to a full array.
  #### - Capacity is cut in half when less than 25% of the capacity is being used.
Here is an image illustrating the format of the data structure:
